### How to create personal pages on Github

That it is a good thing to have personal pages or a blog. And the easiest way to get one (for a developer) is to create it on Github.

It is easy as 1-2-3:

1. get yourself a github account
2. create a repository under your account named `<account>/<account>.github.io`
3. create `README.md` file in repository root

And that's it. You have your own blog space.
